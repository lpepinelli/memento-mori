## 🎯 Overview
Have you ever wondered how many days you have left to live? It's a morbid thought, but one that has crossed my mind more than once, so I decided to create a personal project to answer this question. The project calculates how many days, hours, and minutes you have left to live based on your age and life expectancy. The idea behind memento-mori is not to scare people or make them depressed. It's actually quite the opposite. By knowing how much time we have left, we can make better decisions about how we spend our days. We can prioritize the things that matter most to us and let go of the things that don't.
